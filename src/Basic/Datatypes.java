 * DataType- Datatype define the type of data that a variable can store.
 * Datatype decide the memory size of our variable
 * Decide the range of value which are stored inside the variable
 * Two types- Primitive and Non-primitive
 * 
 * 
 * Primitive- Those datatype whose memory fixed its called primitive datatypes.
 * Non-primitive- Those datatype whose memory is not fixed.
 * 
 * P--->size---> byte-1 byte (-128 to 127), sort-2 byte (-32,768 to 32,767), int-4, long-8, float-4, double-8, char-2, boolean-1 bit
 *
 * NP- Array, String, class, interface
 * int arr[]={1,3,6} ===> int means 4 byte-> 4*3==>12 that means once you gives the size based on that memory space is decide
